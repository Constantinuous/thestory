UX Design

\begin{description}

	\item [Paper prototyping] might be the best option if you need to explore many different options quickly when sitting down with your users.
    \item [A low-fi software prototype] (Balsamiq, etc.) might be the best option if you have to get somebody to use something remotely, or if you need to capture more realistic interactions
    \item [A quick HTML prototype] might be best if you need to explore responsive design options on multiple devices.
    \item [A partial implementation] might be the best option if you need to do something like A/B test a new option against your existing product.
