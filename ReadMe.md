Hello an welcome to the story - as told by me - of Software Engineering. A Story build on the shoulders of giants. That is most of the writing is by smarter men and I just summarize it here. I intend this story to be a reference for myself. That means it will grow and shrink whenever I find something new to summarize or consider other stuff obvious and remove it.
